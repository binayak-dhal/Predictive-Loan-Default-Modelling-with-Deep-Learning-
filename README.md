The dataset used was fetched from LendingClub Financial Services, consisting of 3 million records of approximately 15 billion dollars in disbursed loans. An initial Exploratory Data Analysis was performed using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to understand the significance of variables, view summary statistics, and visualize the data.
